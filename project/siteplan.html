    <h1>E-commerce Site Plan</h1>

    <!-- Site Name -->
    <h2>Site Name</h2>
    <p><strong>Turkanaboy Market Hub</strong></p>
    <p>I chose this name because it reflects a modern, easy to navigate online shopping platform blending the cradle of mankind origin to offer a wide range of classified products and services. The name conveys both area of operation ("Turkana") and convenience ("Market").</p>

    <!-- Purpose -->
    <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
    <p>
    The site will provide subscribers with a free platform to post classified advertisements for both products and services. By enabling residents to list items locally at no cost, the platform will significantly increase access to goods and services across Turkana County. This local-first approach reduces the need for long-distance travel to major towns or markets, helping users save money, time, and transport-related expenses. 
    <br> In addition, the platform promotes healthy market competition by creating a space where many sellers can showcase their offerings. This helps reduce monopoly-driven pricing, ensuring that consumers have more choices at fairer prices. Ultimately, the website will serve as a digital marketplace designed to empower communities, stimulate local trade, and connect buyers and sellers conveniently within their own region.<br>
